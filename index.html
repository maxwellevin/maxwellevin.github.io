<h3>Maxwell Shannon Levin</h3>

<p>
I am an aspiring Software Engineer, Machine Learning enthusiast, and hobbyist photographer based out of Portland, Oregon. 
I have a B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Lewis & Clark College (Portland, Oregon). 
I took my first CS class as a freshman in college and immediately began pursuing it further because I loved being able to tackle problems that had previously seemed too monumental to approach.
Most of the problems I've tackled since my freshman year have involved stochastic processes and simulation, which is exciting for me, but my favorite coding projects have been those with practical value. 
</p>

<p>
When I'm not coding something practical (or random) you can find me outside hiking, playing soccer or basketball, climbing, or taking photos.
You can also find me inside editing said photos, cooking, reading, playing with my cat, or watching netflix. 
I occassionally organize camping trips with friends that involve most or all of the activities above in addition to stargazing. 
Additionally, I'm always looking for new projects to work on and new technologies to experiment with.
If you have any project ideas for me or if you would like me on your team please <a href="/contact">contact me</a>!
