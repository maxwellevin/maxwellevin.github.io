<h3>Maxwell Shannon Levin</h3>

<p>
    I am a software/web developer, machine learning enthusiast, and recent graduate of Lewis & Clark College. I was born
    and raised in San Diego, CA, but I've lived in Portland, OR for the past 4 years and counting. In my spare time you
    can find me tinkering with arduino / raspberry pi, experimenting with machine learning / ai technologies, picking up
    fun and challenging new projects, taking photos of the night sky and landscapes, hiking, playing soccer or
    basketball, and cooking.
