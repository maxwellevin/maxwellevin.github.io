<h3>Maxwell Shannon Levin</h3>

<p>
    I am a web developer, machine learning enthusiast, and recent graduate. I was born and raised in San Diego, CA but
     moved to Portland, OR for college and I've remained there ever since. I still enjoy visiting San Diego for
    friends, family, and the warm weather. In my spare time you can find me tinkering with aduino/raspberry pi, taking
    photos of the milky way and other things, playing soccer or basketball, learning about machine learning techniques,
    or cooking.
