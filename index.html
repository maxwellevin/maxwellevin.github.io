<h3>Hello!</h3>

<p>
I am a Software Engineer, Machine Learning enthusiast, and hobbyist photographer currently based out of Tri-Cities, Washington. 
I have a B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Lewis & Clark College, where I discovered my love for programming and problem-solving. 
I took my first CS class as a freshman in college and immediately began pursuing it further because I loved being able to tackle problems that had previously seemed too monumental to approach.
Most of the problems I've tackled since my freshman year have involved stochastic processes and simulation, which is exciting for me, but my favorite coding projects have been those with practical value. 
</p>

<p>
When I'm not coding you can find me outside hiking, playing soccer or basketball, climbing, or taking photos.
You can also find me in the great indoors editing said photos, cooking, reading, playing with my cat, or watching netflix. 
I occasionally organize camping trips with friends that involve most or all of the activities above in addition to stargazing. 
Additionally, I'm always looking for new projects to work on and new technologies to experiment with. 
If you have any recommendations for things I should look into or if you would simply like to connect with me, feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>!
