### Motivation

I am someone who always does their best to prepare. When I took Math 490 my junior year of college I had no prior
experience with statistics. Yung-Pin Chen allowed me to take his course because he knew that I had programming and 
mathematical experience/skills and that I ask useful questions in class. He is also a very kind person who works hard to
see his students succeed. 

Prior to beginning the semester I decided to focus on learning R (the language we would be using in class) so that I 
would have a little bit catch-up work to do early on in the semester. It was when I was learning about R Studio that
I first discovered the idea of a computational essay and decided to try my hand at it. 


### Tools Used

I used R Studio to do all my coding. I created R Markdown projects, which are typed in a standard Markdown language.
R Studio lets you embed and run code in your Markdown project so I used R when applicable on the daily homework
assignments. When my assignments were due, I exported my markdown to an html document through R Studio and printed the 
results. Later in the semester I learned that I could install a small(ish) version of LaTeX that would allow me to 
export my homework as a pdf document, and I began to do this. Additionally, I learned that I could use programming
languages other than R with my Markdown. I used this to my advantage during our section on Monte Carlo simulations
when I occasionally chose to code in Python instead of R in order to get performance improvements.
