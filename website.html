    <h3>Sorting Hat</h3>
    <p>Sorting Hat is a tool designed to quickly allocate hundreds of first-year students into their mandatory
        Exploration and Discovery (E&D) seminar courses. This project was developed over the course of a semester at
        Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon, and my team consisted of Lars Mayrand, Nick Tan, Mack Beveridge, Sam
        Peers Nitzberg, and James Tostado.</p>
