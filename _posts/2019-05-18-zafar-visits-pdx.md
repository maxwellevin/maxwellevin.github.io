Zafar is one of my oldest and closest friends. We've been organizing star gazing trips, hiking, and hanging out since 
our early high school days. For the past four years we've only been able to see each other when our vacation periods
aligned (which was far too infrequently). This weekend, Zafar and Elizabeth took a Friday off of classes and came to
visit me in Portland, OR. 
 
Activities included: Seeing Multnomah Falls and hiking around Latourell Falls, taking many, many photos, seeing behind 
the scenes of <a href="https://twitter.com/exoPaperBot">@exoPaperBot</a>, going climbing at planet granite, getting 
donuts from Voodoo Donuts, exploring Powell's, and eating lots of really good food.
