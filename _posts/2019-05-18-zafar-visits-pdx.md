Zafar is one of my oldest and closest friends. We've been organizing star gazing trips, hiking, and hanging out since our early high school days. For the past four years we've only been able to see each other when our vacation periods aligned (which was far too infrequently). Fortunately, Zafar has always wanted to see Oregon, so he and his girlfriend Elizabeth took a Friday off of classes at UCSC and came to visit me in Portland, OR.

Activities included exploring downtown Portland, touring Lewis & Clark College, hiking around Multnomah and Latourell Falls, going bouldering and climbing at [Planet Granite](https://planetgranite.com/pdx/), eating [Voodoo Donuts](https://www.voodoodoughnut.com/), buying Machine Learning and Physics books from [Powell's](https://www.powells.com/), seeing behind the scenes of Zafar's [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/exoPaperBot), cooking really yummy food, playing with my cat Lando, and much more!
