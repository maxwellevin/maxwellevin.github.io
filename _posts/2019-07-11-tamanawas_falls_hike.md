Today Allie and I hiked the Tamanawas Falls trail near Mt. Hood. Earlier in the day we visited the Bonneville Fish hatchery and ate lunch at a local fish market. 

The trail was steep and difficult at times so I did not take as many shots as I would have liked. That being said, here are a few of my favorites from the trail.
