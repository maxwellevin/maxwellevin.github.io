While I was visiting friends and family in San Diego, CA, my parents and I made the incredible decision to take a day trip north to Lake Elsinore where the massive California Poppy bloom was taking place. Upon arrival we saw hundreds, if not thousands, of other tourists flocking to the hills to witness the superbloom firsthand.

Below are a handful of pictures I took during our hike through the hills. Not pictured are my parents and the hundreds of people we passed along the way.
