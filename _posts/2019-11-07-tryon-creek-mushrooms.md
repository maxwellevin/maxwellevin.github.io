excerpt: Looking for mushrooms in Tryon Creek
---

Today Allie and I ventured a little closer to home. We explored Tryon Creek near Lewis & Clark College in Portland, OR and looked for mushrooms on the forest floor. We weren't sure if any of the mushrooms we spotted were edible so unfortunately we weren't able to take any home with us. Nevertheless, looking for them was still pretty fun and I was able to capture a few with my camera. If you know what any of the mushrooms below are, let me know!
