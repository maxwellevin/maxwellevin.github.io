### Maxwell Shannon Levin
I am a web developer, machine learning enthusiast, and recent graduate. I was born and raised in San Diego, CA but later
moved to Portland, OR for college and I've remained there ever since. I still enjoy visiting San Diego for friends, 
family, and the warm weather. In my spare time you can find me tinkering with aduino/raspberry pi, taking photos of the
 milky way and other things, playing soccer or basketball, learning about machine learning techniques, or cooking.
