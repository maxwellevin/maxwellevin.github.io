A brief recap of my professional experience.



### Education

**Bachelor of Arts: Computer Science and Mathematics** from Lewis & Clark College in Portland, OR (May 2019)

**Awards**: Departmental honors in Computer Science and Mathematics, Pi Mu Epsilon

**GPA**: 3.74 (*Cum Laude*)


### Experience 

#### Software Engineer I
**Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (PNNL) / Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)**, *April 2020 - Present*
- Improved availability and quality of scientific data by developing aerosol data products through direct collaboration with ARM climate scientists while meeting rigorous ARM data quality standards.
- Built or expanded various tools to manage ARM publication databases, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of how ARM climate data is used by the public.
- Resolved issues relating to data and engineering workflows, answered user questions, and more as a ServiceNow Administrator.


#### Software Development Engineer                                                                                                                   
**Lewis & Clark College**, *Jan. 2018 - April 2020*
- Designed and built applications for automating freshman seminar assignments, a task previously done by hand using Excel.
- Delivered .JAR application in Spring 2018 that places all students into one of their top 3 choices, exceeding client’s goals.
- Used Agile software development practices, leading to an increase in developer productivity and client satisfaction.
- Built [www.sortinghat.org](http://www.sortinghat.org) to increase functionality for 2020 adjustments to the freshman seminar series.

#### Undergraduate Research Assistant: Machine Learning / Computer Vision
**Lewis & Clark College**, *May 2018 - June 2019*
- Researched effectiveness of CNNs on the segmentation of cloudy sky images compared to standard thresholding algorithm.
- Adapted Python codebase for cluster computer with over 140 CPUs, resulting in massive image-processing speedups.
- Examined dataset of over 100k sky images and fractional sky covers (FSC) and split into training and validation sets.
- Trained on 60k sky images, achieving 90% validation accuracy and more a accurate FSC than threshold approach.
- Meticulously documented over 100 experiments and presented research at several PNW conferences.
- Worked to familiarize future researchers with the codebase and project goals during Summer 2019.

#### Tutor: Math, CS, Physics
**Symbolic & Quantitative Resource Center**, *Sep. 2016 - May 2019*
- Taught positive psychology techniques and modelled good study habits, resulting in an increase of students’ self-efficacy.
- Coordinated with professors and other tutors to track students’ progress through particularly challenging material.


#### Homework Grader: PHYS 451 - Theoretical Dynamics
**Lewis & Clark College**, *Jan. 2019 - May 2019*
- Recorded homework scores and reported common areas in weekly meetings with the professor.
- Graded weekly homework assignments for ~16 students.


#### Teaching Assistant: CS 383 - Algorithm Design & Analysis
**Lewis & Clark College**, *Sep. 2018 - Dec. 2018*
- Responsible for taking role and helping with homework, allowing the professor more time to focus on lectures and tests.
- Worked closely with students during office hours, resulting in improved student comprehension and higher test scores.
